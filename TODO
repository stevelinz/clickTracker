With a partner, you will be creating a "Click Tracker" web page.

First, create an HTML page with two buttons.

The first button, when clicked, adds one to a variable that keeps track of the number of clicks.
The second button, when clicked, uses an alert() to let the user know how many times the first button was clicked.

The message should say "You clicked x times" where x is the number of times the first button was clicked.

All of the JavaScript code should be placed in an external file.

Submit:
	•	the URL of your GitHub repository
	•	the URL of your Netlify site
